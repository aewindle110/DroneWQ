DroneWQ is a Python package that can be used to analyze multispectral data collected from a drone to derive ocean color radiometry and water quality properties. These scripts are specific for the MicaSense RedEdge and Altum cameras. `DroneWQ` processes raw pixel values to remote sensing reflectance and ultimately creates orthomosaics of water quality parameters which can be used to identify algal blooms, assess water quality health, and track ecosystem changes over time.

.. note::

    What does the WQ stand for? Water Quality!
