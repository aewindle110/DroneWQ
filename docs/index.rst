Citing DroneWQ
----------------------

If you use CameraTransform for academic research, you are highly encouraged (though not
required) to cite the following paper:

*  Gerum, R., Richter, S., Winterl, A., Mark, M., Fabry, B., Le Bohec, C., and Zitterbart, D.P. (2019),
   `"CameraTransform: A Python package for perspective corrections and image mapping" <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2019.100333>`_.
   SoftwareX doi:10.1016/j.softx.2019.100333

CameraTransform is developed primarily by academics, and so citations matter a lot to
us. Citing CameraTransform also increases it's exposure and potential user
(and developer) base, which is to the benefit of all users of CameraTransform. Thanks
in advance!
