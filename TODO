- Add option in rrs_std_pixel_masking() to calculate mean and std of Rrs(NIR) from random n images (right now it just takes first n images)

- Can't figure out how to ignore warnings even with functions I listed at the top and in utils.py. 

- write a line so code knows its 5 or 6 bands (altum) so it does proper calculation on line 718 (print('Processing a total of ' + str(len(files)) + ' captures or ' + str(round(len(files)/5)) + ' image sets.')

- first image in estuarine_dataset was taken minutes before and on land compared to the rest. thinking we should delete it so it doesnt mess up mosacking?

- save_wq_imgs needs to be written more efficiently

- add cmocean to docker container
